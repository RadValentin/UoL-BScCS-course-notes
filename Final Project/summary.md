# Final Project
Lecturer: Dr Marco Gillies
Module leader: Dr Sarah Rauchas

## Notes
- You *must* engage with your tutor, especially at the proposal stage of the project. You will be given the tutor's email address for this purpose, forums are also available. Tutors offer guidance and feedback.
- The exam is related to the project process and how your own project's process.
- Things not to overlook: literature review (market research), consistent referencing, evaluation plan (self assessment of own work).

A good overview can be found on [REPL](https://world-class.github.io/REPL/modules/level-6/cm-3070-final-project/).

### Key deadlines
- **Week 5**: Submit a proposal from a template. It kind of becomes the "introduction" in final report. Includes a project concept, related work and video presentation for practice.
- **Week 11**: Preliminary project report, submit background research, more details about the plan and design and a first prototype. It becomes the literature review, background research, evaluation plan and design section of the final report. Have to have started programming substantially by then.
- **Week 15**: Receive marked preliminary report.
- **Week 17**: Draft of report (not counted but recommended to do). Becomes part of the "implementation" section in the report.
- **Week 19**: Receive feedback on draft report.

## Week 1
The phases of a project: Discovery, Design, Development, Delivery + Testing.

### Discovery (Weeks 1 - 6)
- Project template from L6 modules
- Background research: domain, users
- Aims for the project
- Project proposal - pitch the idea
  - Does the video display knowledge of the area of study and previous work?
  - Does the video critically evaluate the previous work? - areas of improvement, niche in the market
  - Is the project concept justified based on the domain and users?
- Literature review

### Design (Weeks 6 - 11)
- Project design
- Work plan
- Evaluation plan - unit testing, user testing
- First prototype

### Development (Weeks 11 - 23)
- Programming
- Testing
- Iteration
- Technical write-up

### Delivery (Weeks 20 - 25)
- Final prototype
- Final report
- Evaluation - were the objectives achieved?
- Video presentation (demo)

**NOTE:** Submission is on/around **Week 25** unlike other modules.

**NOTE:** Don't sleep on Peer-Reviews, they can help inform your own project work.

### Assessment points
- *Week 4* - Proposal video (formative) - *FEEDBACK*
- *Week 10* - Preliminary report and prototype (10%)
- *Week 18* - Draft report (formative) - *FEEDBACK*
- Progress quizzes (5%)
- Exam (20%)
- *Week 24/25* - Final report (60%) and video (5%)

> FOCUS ON COMPLETENESS: REPORT, IMPLEMENTATION, EVALUATION

## Week 2
### Critiquing previous work 
- "Does the video display knowledge of the area of study, previous work or academic literature?"
- "Does the video critically evaluate the previous work and/or academic literature?"
- benefits, what's missing, areas of improvement
- don't take claims at face value, verify and evaluate how they apply

### Time planning
Create a Gantt chart or use a tool like Trello to plan your project and track your progress. Consider having a work journal document as well where you write what you did each week. You can also use it to keep track of challenges faced, what worked/didn't work and ideas that you have.

## Week 3
### Project proposal
Testing during discovery: Does your background research support your idea?

Ethics concerns: 
- research with human participants
  - subjects need to be informed what the study is about, how their data will be used
  - typically an information sheet or consent form is used
- broader harms - environmental harm, societal harm, etc.
- conflicts of interest - financial or personal involvement
- personal data - how data is stored securely, permission to use personal data
- copyrighted content

## Week 4

### Preliminary report structure
- **Introduction**
  - State what template you're using right at the beginning of the report, in the introduction.
- **Literature Review**
- **Design**
- **Demo Video**
  - Don't speed it up in editing
  - Develop the ability to curate what you present
