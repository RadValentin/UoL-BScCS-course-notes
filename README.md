# UoL BScCS Course Notes
Notes taken while studying [BSc Computer Science offered by Goldsmiths, University of London](https://www.london.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/bsc-computer-science) from April 2021 to March 2025.

## Notes list
### Level 4
#### [CM1005 Introduction to Programming I](./Introduction%20to%20Programming%20I/sumary.md)
> [!TIP] 
> Work on the Sleuth cases as soon as you can, they make up 50% of the final grade, don't leave them all for the end.

#### [CM1040 Web Development](./Web%20Development/summary.md)
> [!TIP] 
> Course material leaves a lot to be desired, make sure to supplement your learning with other online resources as you'll likely need to build websites in future modules (DNW, AWD, DADT, etc).

### Level 5
TODO

### Level 6
#### [CM3005 Data Science](./Data%20Science/notes.md)
>[!TIP]
> Make sure to evaluate your own work (self-evaluation) in the midterm report. It's easy to not pay attention to this and you'll lose points for it.

#### [CM3035 Advanced Web Development](./Advanced%20Web%20Development/summary.md) - *IN PROGRESS*
> [!TIP]
> Redis doesn't run natively on Windows but you can use WSL to get around this limitation, see [this guide](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/install-redis-on-windows/).

> [!TIP]
> Learn how to deploy your app to AWS or some other hosting service. This is worth 10% of both the midterm and final grade.

#### [CM3045 3D Graphics and animation](./3D%20Graphics%20&%20Animation/summary.md)
> [!TIP] 
> Make sure to do the peer-review lab exercises. Those before Week 10 will be part of the midterm and those after can/will show up in the exam.

## Tips & Tricks
**Don't sleep on the midterms**
Start working on the midterm assignments as soon as they're given to you. The midterm is usually less demanding then the finals as it covers only the first 10 weeks of lectures and it's a good opportunity to get a good grade at the end. Midterm weighs 30% to 50% of the final grade. **If you fail the midterm, you will fail the module** so don't leave it for the last possible moment.

**Don't skip the peer-review assignments** (even the essay ones)
There's very little homework in most modules, same for exercises or opportunities for hands-on work so doing the peer-reviews gives you a way to recap what was taught and put it into practice. It's a good way to sediment the information and get some practice in.

**Most readings are optional**
Readings offer extra information on top what was taught but they can sometimes be superfluous. Before committing multiple hours to reading from a textbook it's useful to check how relevant the information is to your own learning. Generally, the math (DM, CM) and theoretical (ADS, FCS) modules have useful readings that enhanced my learning, for the rest of the modules it was more hit-or-miss. Use your best judgement.

**Math modules can give the best grades**
You'll soon find out that most modules leave a lot of room for interpretation when it comes to grading, with *~30%* of the grade being reserved for *stellar work*. In other words if you do everything like it was taught you get a maximum of 70%. The math modules on the other hand are easier to "game", if you do all the exercises correctly you get the top marks, so keep this in mind.

**Team assignments eat up a LOT of time**
