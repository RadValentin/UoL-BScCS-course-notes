## Notes list

- [CM1005 Introduction to Programming I](./Introduction%20to%20Programming%20I/sumary.md)
  - Note: Work on the Sleuth cases as soon as you can, don't leave them all for the end.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Don't sleep on the midterms** - start working on the midterm assignments as soon as they're given to you. The midterm is usually less demanding then the finals as it covers only the first 10 weeks of lectures and it's a good opportunity to get a good grade at the end. Midterm weighs 30% to 50% of the final grade. **If you fail the midterm, you will fail the module** so don't leave it for the last possible moment.
- **Don't skip the peer-review assignments** (even the essay ones) - there's very little homework in most modules, same for exercises or opportunities for hands-on work so doing the peer-reviews gives you a way to recap what was taught and put it into practice. It's a good way to sediment the information and get some practice in.
